## Overview

This project is a fully functional E-commerce website template created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a basic structure for an online store, with pages for product listings, user authentication, and a checkout process. This template can serve as a starting point for building a more complex and feature-rich E-commerce platform.

## Features

- **Shopping Cart**: Integration for managing cart items.
- **Checkout Process**: A payment page to simulate the checkout process.
- **Contact Page**: A form for users to contact customer support.
- **About Us Page**: Information about the company or the website.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following files and directories:

### Root Directory

### Images Directory
